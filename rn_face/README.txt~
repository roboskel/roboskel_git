RN_FACE

A face detection and tracking ROS node written by SKEL for Researcher's Night 2013. It presents an improvement on using simple OpenCV
face detection (which utilizes Haar cascades) by integrating the head coordinates of each person in front of the camera provided by
the Microsoft Kinect mounted on Sek's mast. By using the OpenNI libraries the program is used to limit the search area in the approximate
area of each user's head, increasing overall accuracy and limiting the lighting and enviroment effects. The package consists of the following nodes :
